In here we have a few coding challenges to help learn, see and work with some real functional programming code. You will find 3 parts:

- part 1 - code is written in imperative style and you must rewrite it in a more functional way
- part 2 - here is functional code with some hidden bugs! Can you solve them?
- part 3 - Here are some links and resources to continue learning more

Good luck!
