## Into the Unknown

There are many great resources out there for learning more about functional programming. 
I've put together the ones that I found helpful along the way here:

If you're looking for a youtube video:
* [One of the best introduction videos - beginner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-5obm1G_FY&ab_channel=JSConf)
* [Making code functional step by step - beginner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfWR3dKnFIo&ab_channel=ReactRally)
* [A step by step at making code functional - medium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG3KuqDbmhM&ab_channel=NDCConferences)

Good reads and blogs:
