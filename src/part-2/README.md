# part 2
## Hidden Mutations

Each file in this part contains a function, written mostly in lodash. However, even though it's written in lodash - there is a still a bug caused by a "hidden" mutation. Hunt down the hidden mutation and fix the code.
A slight change in a single line will fix it. Hopefully this will demonstrate how tricky and annoying they can be.

Test your result with:

`npm run part-2`
